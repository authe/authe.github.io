I am a senior economist in the Financial Markets Analysis and Research Division (FMD) of the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/) and a research affiliate of the London School of Economics' [Systemic Risk Centre](http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk/). My research is in financial economics with a particular interest in market structure and design, financial intermediation, and financial regulation.
